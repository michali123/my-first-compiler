At this point we're just about finished with the structure of our
expression parser.   This version of the program should correctly
parse and compile just about any expression you care to  throw at
it.

1. open termial
2. go to path where Cradle.pas is located
3. compile file with Free Pascal Compiler: fpc Cradle.pas
4. run object file created: Cardle
5. now we can parse and compile any math expression! :

1+2 
1+2-9
8*45
2+31-2-0
-1
(4+5)/9

etc.
