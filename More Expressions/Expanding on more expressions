simple parser that  could handle arbitrarily complex expressions,
with two restrictions:

  o No variables were allowed, only numeric factors

  o The numeric factors were limited to single digits

In this installment, we'll get  rid of those restrictions.  We'll
also extend what  we've  done  to  include  assignment statements
function  calls  and. 


Handling with whitespce and this installmnet summary:
Now the parser is complete.  It's got every feature we can put in
a  one-line "compiler."  Tuck it away in a safe place.  Next time
we'll move on to a new subject, but we'll still be  talking about
expressions for quite awhile.  Next installment, I plan to talk a
bit about interpreters as opposed  to compilers, and show you how
the structure of the parser changes a bit as we change  what sort
of action has to be taken.  The information we pick up there will
serve  us in good stead later on, even if you have no interest in
interpreters.  See you next time.
