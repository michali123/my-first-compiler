## Commnets
a) The code is ported to 68000 assembly, I have used the following links as a guide and as a reference:
 1. https://simpledevcode.wordpress.com/2016/12/15/mini-guide-to-68000-assembly-programming/
 2. https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/M68000PRM.pdf

b) The compiler development is based on Professor Michael Vulis' class material and his notes, as well as on the great book for beginners I found online:
"Let's Build a Compiler, by Jack Crenshaw, Ph.D."
