In  the  first  four  installments  of  this  series, we've  been
concentrating on the parsing of math  expressions  and assignment
statements.  In  this  installment,  we'll  take off on a new and
exciting  tangent:  that   of  parsing  and  translating  control
constructs such as IF statements.


Give it a try now.  Try something like

   aiblcede

Did it work?  Now, just  to  be  sure we haven't broken the ELSE-
less case, try

   aibece

Now try some nested IF's.  Try anything you like,  including some
badly formed statements.   Just  remember that 'e' is not a legal
"other" statement.


Give it a try.  Once again,  don't  forget  to  add  the  call in
Block.    Since  we don't have any input for the dummy version of
Expression, a typical input line would look something like

     afi=bece

Well, it DOES generate a lot of code, doesn't it?    But at least
it's the RIGHT code.
